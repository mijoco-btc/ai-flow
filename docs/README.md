# DAO and Crews

The goal is to explore how eDAO in its current form can be integrated with Bitcoin AIX Crews and Resource Contracts.

Class Diagrams

Note: class diagrams often denote access rights to methods. Adapting this concept for Clarity using UML conventions leads to;

\- everyone (anyone can do it)

\- asset owner (FT, NFT, etc)

\- dao deployer / contract owner

\- group access (assigned roles)

\- base-dao access (self)

\- extension access (self)

These are meant as a guide as they are checks implemented in business logic as opposed to structurally within Clarity but are used here just as a way to discuss authorisation concepts at the model level.\
