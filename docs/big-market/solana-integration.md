# Solana Integration

The use case! \
Specifically we have a prediction market app on stacks where users can stake sBTC (stacks bridged bitcoin sip10 asset) and win sBTC. We want to open this application up to solana (and also SUI eventually) users so they can stake in the markets directly with their sol wallet and then claim directly. Of the potential cross chain bridging options, which aligns best here? and is the Zeus network a possible solution?

Got it! Since your **prediction market on Stacks** already uses **sBTC (Stacks-bridged Bitcoin as a SIP-10 asset)** and you want to open it up to **Solana (and eventually SUI) users**, the best approach will focus on **cross-chain staking and claiming** in the least intrusive way.

***

### **Best Approach for Your Use Case**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Chain Staking & Claiming with a Bridge (Best Fit)**

The most effective solution is to **create a Solana-Stacks bridge that enables users to stake SOL (or BTC on Solana) and receive sBTC-backed rewards on Stacks**.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Solana users stake assets** in a Solana program (e.g., SOL, stSOL, or a Solana-based wrapped BTC).
2. A **Solana smart contract locks the staked amount** and mints a **wrapped sBTC (wBTC-SOL)** that represents their stake on Stacks.
3. A **bridge relayer submits proof** of this stake to your Stacks smart contract.
4. The **Stacks contract acknowledges the stake** and updates the user‚Äôs position in the prediction market.
5. After the prediction market settles, **winners claim their rewards** in **sBTC on Stacks**.
6. The **bridge relayer allows users to redeem** their sBTC on **Solana as wBTC-SOL or native SOL/BTC**.

**Why This Works Best:**

‚úÖ **Users keep using Phantom Wallet**‚Äîno need for a Stacks wallet.\
‚úÖ **Prediction market logic stays the same**‚Äîyou only need a staking mechanism for cross-chain assets.\
‚úÖ **No trust assumptions on custodial solutions**‚Äîeverything is verifiable with a decentralized bridge.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Can Zeus Network Help?**

Yes, **Zeus Network** could be a great fit for this! Zeus is a cross-chain liquidity protocol for **bridging assets across Solana, Bitcoin, and other chains**, and it offers **sBTC integrations**.

üîπ **Why Zeus Network?**

* It **already supports Bitcoin-native assets**, meaning it could act as a **Solana-Stacks bridge for sBTC**.
* If they support **wrapped sBTC on Solana**, users could **stake directly with their Phantom Wallet** and interact with your prediction market.
* It can **abstract away bridging complexity** so users don‚Äôt need to manually wrap and move funds.

üöÄ **Next Step**:\
Check **if Zeus Network supports Stacks and sBTC**. If not, a custom bridge may be required, but Zeus could still be used as an **off-ramp** for sBTC back to Solana users.

***

### **How to Implement This**

If Zeus Network works:

1. **Integrate Zeus API** to handle staking on Solana and mint wrapped sBTC for Stacks.
2. Modify your **Stacks Clarity smart contract** to accept wrapped deposits from Zeus.
3. Let Solana users **claim their rewards back to Solana via Zeus**.

If Zeus doesn‚Äôt support Stacks yet:

1. **Build a bridge** that uses **Wormhole or Hyperlane** to verify Solana stakes on Stacks.
2. Wrap **staked SOL as sBTC on Stacks**.
3. Allow users to **claim winnings and redeem them on Solana**.

***

#### **Does This Approach Align With Your Goals?**

If you want **users to stake on Solana and participate in the Stacks prediction market seamlessly**, **Zeus + a custom verification bridge** seems ideal.

Integrating **Zeus Network** into your Stacks-based prediction market can enable **Solana users** to participate using their **Phantom Wallets**, thereby broadening your user base. Here's how you can approach this integration:

***

#### **1. Understanding Zeus Network's Capabilities**

Zeus Network serves as a **communication layer between Bitcoin and Solana**, facilitating the seamless integration of Bitcoin liquidity into the Solana ecosystem. It enables the creation of **programmable Bitcoin assets** on Solana, such as **zBTC**, which are tokenized representations of Bitcoin.

***

#### **2. Proposed Integration Strategy**

**a. Tokenization of sBTC on Solana:**

* **Objective:** Allow Solana users to stake in your Stacks prediction market using assets they hold in their Phantom Wallets.
* **Approach:** Utilize Zeus Network to create a **Solana-compatible token** that represents **sBTC**.
  * **Token Creation:** Develop a **wrapped sBTC token (wsBTC)** on Solana, leveraging Zeus Network's infrastructure.
  * **Minting Process:** When a user wants to participate:
    * They **lock their Bitcoin** (or sBTC) using Zeus Network's protocol.
    * An equivalent amount of **wsBTC is minted** on Solana and credited to their Phantom Wallet.

**b. Cross-Chain Interaction:**

* **Staking in Prediction Market:**
  * Users **stake wsBTC** in a **Solana-based smart contract** designed to interface with your Stacks prediction market.
  * This contract **communicates** with your Stacks application, registering the user's stake.
* **Claiming Rewards:**
  * Upon winning, the **reward is allocated** in sBTC within your Stacks application.
  * The user can then **redeem** this sBTC by:
    * **Burning** the corresponding wsBTC on Solana.
    * **Unlocking** the original sBTC or Bitcoin through Zeus Network's protocol.

***

#### **3. Implementation Considerations**

* **Smart Contract Development:**
  * Create or adapt **Solana smart contracts** to handle wsBTC staking and interface with your Stacks application.
* **Cross-Chain Communication:**
  * Ensure **secure and reliable messaging** between Solana and Stacks platforms, possibly leveraging existing cross-chain protocols or developing custom solutions.
* **User Experience:**
  * Design the process to be **intuitive**, allowing users to stake and claim rewards with minimal steps, all within their Phantom Wallet environment.

***

#### **4. Engaging with Zeus Network**

* **Collaboration:**
  * Reach out to **Zeus Network** to discuss potential collaboration and support for your integration.
* **Technical Support:**
  * Seek guidance on best practices for implementing wsBTC and ensuring seamless cross-chain operations.

***

By leveraging Zeus Network's infrastructure, you can effectively enable Solana users to participate in your Stacks-based prediction market, enhancing accessibility and expanding your user base.
