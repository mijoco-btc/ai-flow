**ChatGPT said:**

If you were to live in your French home and rent out your **2–3 bedroom Edwardian apartment in Hove (just minutes from the sea and a 20‑minute walk to Brighton city centre)**, here’s what you could realistically expect in short‑term (Airbnb-style) rental income:

#### Projected Earnings

Let’s break it down into two scenarios:

| Scenario                   | ADR (£/night) | Occupancy (%) | Booked Nights/Year | Estimated Annual Income (£) |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Market Average**         | 124           | 63            | \~230              | \~28,500                    |
| **Hove (2-bed, Seafront)** | 200           | 75            | \~274              | \~54,800                    |

* The **market average scenario**, applying the general Brighton & Hove data, suggests about **£27k–£30k/year**.
* However, for an **Edwardian 2–3 bed near the sea**, you're likely closer to the **Hove-specific figures (£200/night, 75% occupancy)**—bringing in **£50k+ annually**, particularly if managed well operationally.

#### Considerations for Actual Net Income

1. **Seasonality**: Expect peak in summer (e.g., May–July), slower rates in winter.
2. **Costs**: Cleaning, utilities, guest turnover, platform fees, and perhaps Airbnb management (10–20%) will reduce net profit.
3. **Compliance**: Local council rules, registration, and tax obligations must be met.
4. **Operational Needs**: High-quality listings with excellent photos, fast messaging responses, and great reviews are essential to maintain high ADR and occupancy.

***

#### Summary: What You Could Earn

* **Conservative estimate (market average):** \~£28k/year
* **Optimistic but realistic for your property:** \~£50–55k/year

This aligns with the strong demand and premium positioning of Hove as both seaside and cultural magnet, especially in your central, walk-to-beach location.

Let me know if you'd like a breakdown of net cash flow after costs, or help running occupancy vs. pricing seasonally—or even suggestions on how to market your listing to maximize earnings.
