## Pros

* **Income angles**: Two gîtes already laid out (each with kitchen/living, beds, baths), so you’ve got a head‑start for holiday lets or multi‑family use. [French Estate Agents](https://www.frenchestateagents.com/french-property-for-sale/view/A22554VIC14/house-for-sale-br%C3%A9moy-calvados-normandy-france)
* **Big-ticket works done**: Listing says the **roof was recently replaced** and **solar panels installed**—huge positives for capex and running costs. [French Estate Agents](https://www.frenchestateagents.com/french-property-for-sale/view/A22554VIC14/house-for-sale-br%C3%A9moy-calvados-normandy-france)
* **Character + story**: **13th‑century** château provenance and a **south‑facing façade** over the valley—marketable features. [French Estate Agents](https://www.frenchestateagents.com/french-property-for-sale/view/A22554VIC14/house-for-sale-br%C3%A9moy-calvados-normandy-france)
* **Layout flexibility**: Right‑hand wing is **part‑renovated** and could be a separate guest house or integrated—useful for phasing works or mixed use. [French Estate Agents](https://www.frenchestateagents.com/french-property-for-sale/view/A22554VIC14/house-for-sale-br%C3%A9moy-calvados-normandy-france)
* **Setting & access**: Elevated rural spot with views; close to **Bayeux/D‑Day beaches** and **Caen** ferries—a clear draw for tourism. [French Estate Agents](https://www.frenchestateagents.com/french-property-for-sale/view/A22554VIC14/house-for-sale-br%C3%A9moy-calvados-normandy-france)

## Cons / Watch‑outs

* **It’s still a renovation**: The château portion needs further work; the right side is only **part‑renovated**. Budget for full diagnostics and trades. [French Estate Agents](https://www.frenchestateagents.com/french-property-for-sale/view/A22554VIC14/house-for-sale-br%C3%A9moy-calvados-normandy-france)
* **Rural dependency**: Up a **private track**, lovely but likely **car‑dependent** for shops/services; check drive times and winter access. [French Estate Agents](https://www.frenchestateagents.com/french-property-for-sale/view/A22554VIC14/house-for-sale-br%C3%A9moy-calvados-normandy-france)
* **Operational complexity**: Running **multiple units** (château + 2 gîtes) = more maintenance, linen/turnover, compliance (tourist registration/taxe de séjour).
* **Unknowns** (not stated in the ad): **Septic system** conformity, **heating system** (beyond a wood burner noted in a gîte), and **DPE/diagnostics**. These can move the budget a lot; get the full _diagnostics techniques_ pack.

## Numbers (rough)

* At **€250k** on **\~168 m²**, you’re \~**€1,488/m²**—cheap for a character asset (the figure likely reflects that more space may exist beyond the listed habitable area and that works are needed).
* **Land** \~**0.52 ha (1.3 acres)**—ample for privacy/amenities. [French Estate Agents](https://www.frenchestateagents.com/french-property-for-sale/view/A22554VIC14/house-for-sale-br%C3%A9moy-calvados-normandy-france)

## Due‑diligence shortlist (next steps)

1. **Full diagnostics**: DPE/energy, electrics, asbestos/lead, septic conformity.
2. **Planning/heritage**: Any constraints (e.g., ABF) for exterior works/solar already done; confirm permissions.
3. **Business model**: Check local occupancy & rates for gîtes near **Bayeux / Saint‑Martin‑des‑Besaces**; validate cleaning/management options. [French Estate Agents](https://www.frenchestateagents.com/french-property-for-sale/view/A22554VIC14/house-for-sale-br%C3%A9moy-calvados-normandy-france)
4. **Works scope & phasing**: Cost the unfinished château wing; confirm roof/solar warranties.
5. **Access/services**: Distance to supermarkets, hospitals, schools; winter road access.

* **Tourist market** is robust around Bayeux and D-Day beaches, with strong high-season occupancy.

***

✅ **Conclusion**:

* **Renovation houses** near Bayeux average **€1,200–1,800/m² purchase**; add €800–1,200/m² renovation.
* **Renovated gîtes** in the same region list closer to **€2,500–3,500/m²** equivalent.
* The Brémoy château looks underpriced relative to the finished market, making it a potentially strong play if you can manage renovations and tourist let logistics.

Would you like me to run a **cash flow example** (purchase + renovation + nightly rate + occupancy → annual yield) specifically for Brémoy vs. a typical Bayeux gîte?
