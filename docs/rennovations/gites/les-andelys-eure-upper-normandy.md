## üìä Strategic Fit

* **Br√©moy (Lower Normandy)** = Better for **tourism investment** (g√Ætes + historic ch√¢teau draw). Lower ‚Ç¨/m¬≤, but renovation heavy.
* **Les Andelys (Upper Normandy)** = Better for **stable residential rental or resale**. Attractive commuter town near Paris, less renovation risk, but no built-in g√Æte income model.

***

‚úÖ In short:

* Choose **Br√©moy** if you want a **heritage project with holiday rental upside** and you‚Äôre comfortable managing renovations + rural logistics.
* Choose **Les Andelys** if you want **lower-risk, town-based property** with **Paris commuter appeal** and less operational complexity.

***

Do you want me to run the **cash-flow scenario comparison** (purchase + renovation + income potential) for these two, so you can see how g√Æte holiday lets vs. long-term rental stack up financially?
