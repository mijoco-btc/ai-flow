# Egg Baskets

## 1. Crowdfunding/BitcoinDao/MixerFM on Stacks

This is a backup strategy.

We put together a deck / couple of graphics for the stacks/bitcoin crowdfunding/dao launcher idea based on the work we just did.

We throw it at Will Cocoran (Grant Manager at Stacks Foundation) and we leave it there.

It'll take them 3 months to decide anything. If they come back and we still have no funding on SUI we take the the SF grant.

## 2. Crowdfunding/MixerFM on SUI

We port the same idea to SUI and pitch.&#x20;

Pros:

* same as above

Cons:

* already 2 projects [SuiPad](https://www.suipad.xyz/) and [SeaPad](https://seapad.fund/)

## 3. MixerFM on SUI

We use existing crowdfunding platform (see above) and focus on launching MixerFM on SUI.

We build out MixerFM and introduce zk login to the app.

Pros:

* traction already

Cons:

* competition is [Mirai](https://blog.sui.io/studio-mirai-pfp-nft-music-platform/)&#x20;

## 4. Infrastructure on SUI

We take the code from [TXTX](projects/dao-internals/dao-and-crews/deployment.md) project and build deployment tools for SUI&#x20;

Pros:&#x20;

* horizontal developer infrastructure has a premium for community / grant applications and dev traction

Cons:

* not as sexy as consumer app

## 5. SUI Bridge

we bring existing zk bridge technology to sui eg zkBridge by Polyhedra Network or build a framework using Winterfell for bridging assets from other chains to sui.

Pros:

* on trend technology

Cons:

* high level of complexity

## 6. SUI ZK-KYC

Started playing with this idea this autumn - basically we create a client side proof of humanity system and use the validation of the zk proof to automatically issue a soul bound NFT (SBT)

Pros:

* horizontal infrastructure
* can be integrated into mixer fm
* has several potential roadmap and integration possibilities
* use Googles Tensorflow AI project for client side facial recognition-based biometric verification or liveness detection with facial matching.

Cons:&#x20;

* can't think of any?
