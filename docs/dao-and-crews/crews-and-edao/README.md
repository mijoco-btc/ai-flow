# Crews and eDAO

## Integrating Crews into Executor DAO

High level modelling and exploration of how eDAO might interact with resource contracts and crews.&#x20;

Open questions;

1. how are crews instantiated? Is there one instance of eDAO managing many crews? Or a one to one relationship?&#x20;
2. does a new crew require contract deployment?
3. how is access control managed?

## Crew and Resource Management

Following suggestion shows flow using resource contracts controlling a 402 payment flow with Crews (collections of human or AI agents) offering services.

Questions

1. How is the equity / company split managed?
   * If set by DAO who can vote?
2. What are the products / services? Is the NFT the product here? Examples of other options / types of product will help make it the model more robust.
