#### **Personal Statement**

The past six months have been busy and include some of the proudest moments of my career. My main endeavours have been development of the [sBTC Bridge](https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc-bridge-web) and [Bridge API](https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc-bridge-api) applications, key parts of the sBTC Testnet program. Contributing to the SIP process by taking part in discussions and reviews and writing high level [design documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UfxMkS9VYy81qPMdEypDmM4di3\_U-Mlb2-X52S3G9hY/edit#heading=h.dzje1vm8krb3). I have had the privilege of representing the Foundation at [Bitcoin Unleashed](https://youtu.be/J\_k0\_S4z6js?t=23143) and sharing the stage with thought leaders in the Bitcoin space.&#x20;

As part of the sBTC testnet program I have supported community devs on Discord and delivered a shared sBTC devnet. Working with developers at Uasu and DLC.link, I've shown how sBTC and DLC technology can be leveraged to enable [sBTC loans](https://uasu.finance/loans/create) - a Bitcoin Defi alternative to depositing directly (commingling BTC) to the sBTC wallet. The solution is currently running on devnet (bitcoin regtest) and testnet.

I am applying now to extend my residency for a further six months to build upon this work.

#### **End Product: What does success look like?**

The next six months of my residency will be about consolidation and exploration.

#### sBTC Bridge

I will consolidate the work so far on the sBTC Bridge by;

* delivery of the [Revealer API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ljh-Gf7lhcmoVJNjdYxx-TMAP3rl1Vka3r7XG09MLnA/edit#heading=h.4nkj8i49w4fu)
* support for deposits using either OP\_DROP (default) or OP\_RETURN transaction formats
* support for the reclaim path

#### Signer Binaries

Provide infrastructure support to community members for running sBTC signer binaries.

#### DLC Technology

Continue to explore DLC and sBTC technology.&#x20;

Look into mechanisms for bridging digital assets between Bitcoin and Stacks blockchain. &#x20;

#### Ecosystem DAO

I will update the work started via Clarity Lab in 2022 - the Ecosystem DAO for Stacks governance to provide the Foundation a robust tool for governance and community engagement using on-chain voting.

### Planning

I will continue to plan and execute my work as transparently and openly as I have over the past 6 months. My sprint planning is available here on Gitbook with issues and pull requests in Github and Daily Updates reported via Discord.
