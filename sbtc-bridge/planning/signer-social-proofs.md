# Signer Social Proofs

## Introduction

The value of the work signers do to maintain the sBTC protocol is enhanced if they are able to link their real world identity to the signing address.

For example if a prominent University were acting as a signer is should be possible to link a zk style proof that enables anyone to verify;

* they own the signer public key
* they control the university DNS records

### DNS Proof User Stories

The first target is to link Domain Name Service.

The Signer's Dashboard will facilitate the following;

1. As an sBTC signer I want to link the institution I represent to my signing key.
2. As an sBTC signer I want to be able to remove the link to my institution
3. As an sBTC signer I want to be able to change the signing key that links to my institution
