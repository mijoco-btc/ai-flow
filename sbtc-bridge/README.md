# sBTC Bridge

sBTC is a SIP-010 fungible token on the Stacks blockchain that can be used in DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, DAOs, governance, and several other use-cases. The sBTC Bridge is a two-way mechanism that allows users to wrap and unwrap BTC as sBTC.&#x20;

The sBTC Bridge is one component to sBTC operations. The full specification of the sBTC protocol is [SIP-021](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/pull/113) and see also the [Master sBTC Design document](https://tmurl.net/master-sbtc-design), which is more up-to-date than the SIP.

The sBTC Bridge supports the following basic features;

* Deposit bitcoin into sBTC tokens on the Stacks network
* Withdraw your sBTC tokens back to bitcoin
* Transaction tracking

Delivery of the sBTC project as a whole has three stages;

* Stage 1 - [Alpha sBTC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R33gZupJg0KsY-vRZYbVFwTHRmq2BCIvyPIVeY0JyGM/edit#heading=h.yr46qe7lks70)
* Stage 2 - [Mini sBTC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R33gZupJg0KsY-vRZYbVFwTHRmq2BCIvyPIVeY0JyGM/edit#heading=h.yr46qe7lks70)
* Stage 3 - [Nakamoto sBTC - SIP-021](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/pull/113)

The Bridge API is an open API that digests Stacks and Bitcoin Blockchain sBTC related data and serves it over a stateless rest API.
